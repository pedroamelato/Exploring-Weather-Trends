# Exploring-Weather-Trends

In this project, my goal was to create a visualization and prepare a write up describing the similarities and differences between global temperature trends and temperature trends in Belo Horizonte, the city where I live.
    
In this project, I had to:

<b> Extract the data: </b> I had to write a SQL query to export the temperature data for the world as well for Belo Horizonte and some favorite cities around the world.

<b> Create a line chart </b> that compared my city’s temperatures with the global temperatures.

<b> Make observations about the similarities and differences </b> between the world averages and my city’s averages, as well as overall trends.
